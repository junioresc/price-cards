# Price Cards
Just some semantic HTML and CSS practice, the most interesting thing I had to do for this design was the ribbon over the middle card which appears to be wrapping around the back of the card.
The buttons have a transition and appear to be animated if the user hovers the cursor over the button
I basically took an image from Adobe Xd and translated it into code
